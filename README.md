# EECS280 Winter(2025): Programming and Introductory Data Structures
https://eecs280.org/

This repository contains the programming projects I completed as part of the EECS 280 (Foundations of Computer Science and Programming) course at the University of Michigan. EECS 280 is a second-semester foundational programming course that focuses on essential computer science concepts and programming skills using C++.

Throughout the course, I worked on a series of projects to deepen my understanding of various topics, including data structures, algorithms, recursion, and object-oriented programming. The course emphasized writing correct and maintainable code, testing, and debugging skills, and the use of C++ language features such as classes, templates, and exceptions.

**Projects Included:**
- Statistics Tool - Implemented a two-sample statistical analysis tool.
- Computer Vision - Developed an image resizing algorithm without distortion. 
- Euchre Game - Simulated the Euchre card game, a popular game in Michigan. 
- Machine Learning - Built a tool to automatically categorize EECS 280 forum posts.
- Text Editor - Created a terminal-based text editor with interactive file manipulation.
- Binary Search Tree - Implemented a map using a binary search tree.

**Key Skills Developed:**
- Linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees.
- Recursion & Functional Abstraction.
- Data Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
- Dynamic resource management and memory handling in C++.
- Testing, debugging, and writing maintainable code.
